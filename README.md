# Algorithms

As I go through different algorithms from various sources, I wanted to publish them in case anyone wanted to come take a look at my proposed solutions.  

#### Organization

Each set of algorithms is organized by what site it came from, and then generally uses the site's organization to find the files, separated into each challenge category.  Each file has the algorithm prompt that needs to be solved, and the solution right below it.  When the algorithms get more complex, I'm going to start commenting within the solutions as a walkthrough for each one.

####  Reach Out!

If you have a better solution for any of the algorithms posted, or you think I made a mistake, I'd love to discuss!  No one wants to stay ignorant for a simpler, more elegant, or more efficient solution!  Just use my contact page at the bottom of my portfolio website.  This is at https://jerryortegadev.com.

Thanks!
